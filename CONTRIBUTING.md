## How to contribute your work

Please open a pull request at https://github.com/stairtree/StructuredAPIClient. Make sure the CI passes, and then wait for code review.

After review you may be asked to make changes.  When you are ready, use the request re-review feature of github or mention the reviewers by name in a comment.
